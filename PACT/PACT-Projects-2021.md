# Project 1: Building a Data Science Pipeline for Intrusion Detection 
**Summary**: In this project, you will research and develop a data science pipeline for intrusion detection by using open-source software and datasets. The approach developed in this project will produce a model for intrusion detection that will (i) be scalable to large volumes of data that could be viewed as a stream, (ii) be able to deal with changes in the data stream, and (iii) must model the intrusion detection from the raw data to the point of inference. Below you will find some references for the project: 

* Data (through IEEE Dataport): [UNSWNB-15](https://ieee-dataport.org/documents/unswnb15-dataset); [Botnet](https://ieee-dataport.org/documents/bot-iot-dataset)
* Software: [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/); [Databricks](https://databricks.com/)

* **Deliverables** 
  - Literature survey on intrusion detection systems and works that reference the UNSWNB-15 and Botnet datasets. 
  - A model for intrusion detection (e.g., preprocessing, classification/detection, etc)
  - Experiments that demonstrate the efficacy of your approach


# Project 2: Adversarial Machine Learning and Intrusion Detection Systems 
**Summary**: This project will research the impact of adversarial machine learning attacks against models for intrusion detection. You will show if and how much adversarial machine learning attacks exploit the IDS that exist in literature.
