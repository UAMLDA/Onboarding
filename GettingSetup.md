# Good to have  
* [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/project) - Online latex editor for writing papers and reports.
* [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/) - Reference manager to keep track of the papers you read. 
* [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/)
* [Evernote](https://evernote.com/) - Good notebook application 
* [Grammarly](https://app.grammarly.com/) - Recommended online tool to check your writing. 
* [Github](https://github.com/) - Good place to backup all of your code (or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org) or [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/))


# Communication / Management 
* [Asana](https://app.asana.com/) - Ask to join the group's Asana account  
* [Slack](https://slack.com/) - Ask to join the group's Slack channel 
* [Zoom](http://zoom.arizona.edu/) - Use the UArizona account to set up meetings 
* You should have some type of task manager (e.g., [Microsoft To-Do](https://todo.microsoft.com/), [Todoist](https://todoist.com/), ...)


# Code / Cloud Resources 
* [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) - This is the recommended version of Python that should be used for development. You will need to install other packages as well but this is a good start. 
* [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) - Most of our code is Tensorflow- or Keras-based, and the UA HPC uses this software as well. 
* [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) - Alternative to Tensorflow for training and evaluating neural networks.
* [Adversarial Robustness Toolbox](https://github.com/Trusted-AI/adversarial-robustness-toolbox) - Python library for adversarial machine learning.  
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Good Python IDE
* [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/) - Good Python IDE
* [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) - Juypter Lab is a bit of an improvement over Jupyter and makes the web browser feel much more like an IDE
* [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) - Great cloud resource for machine learning and deploying your code in a cloud environment. 
* [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/) 
* [DataBricks](https://community.cloud.databricks.com/login.html)
