# About 

This repo contains useful information for working with PI Ditzler, and the Machine Learning and Data Analytics Lab. The contents here a meant to make the transition to working with the group as seamless as possible by providing information about software, cloud-based resources, and useful papers to get started with research. 

Feel free to make a pull request if a link is not active, out of date, or there is something that would be useful to new students joining the group.
