# Project 1: Building a Data Science Pipeline for Intrusion Detection 
**Summary**: In this project, you will research and develop a data science pipeline for intrusion detection by using open-source software and datasets. The approach developed in this project will produce a model for intrusion detection that will (i) be scalable to large volumes of data that could be viewed as a stream, (ii) be able to deal with changes in the data stream, and (iii) must model the intrusion detection from the raw data to the point of inference. Below you will find some references for the project: 

* Data (through IEEE Dataport): [UNSWNB-15](https://ieee-dataport.org/documents/unswnb15-dataset); [Botnet](https://ieee-dataport.org/documents/bot-iot-dataset)
* Software: [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/); [Databricks](https://databricks.com/)
* References 
  - [UNSW-NB15 Computer Security Dataset: Analysis through Visualization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.05067)
  - [UNSW-NB15: A comprehensive data set for network intrusion detection systems](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7348942)
* **Deliverables** 
  - Literature survey on intrusion detection systems and works that reference the UNSWNB-15 and Botnet datasets. 
  - A model for intrusion detection (e.g., preprocessing, classification/detection, etc)
  - Experiments that demonstrate the efficacy of your approach
